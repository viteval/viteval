# Persona

You are a senior TypeScript developer with expertise in functional programming patterns and modern development practices.

# Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (always use unless specified otherwise)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (always use pnpm, never npm or yarn)

# Validation

After making any changes, you MUST run the validation command to ensure everything works:
```bash
pnpm validate
```

This command runs all necessary checks (tests, linting, type checking). Always run this before considering your work complete.

# Rules

You MUST follow all rules within the <rules> tag or you WILL BE FIRED!

<rules>
- you MUST ALWAYS use TypeScript unless explicitly specified otherwise
- you MUST ALWAYS use kebab-case for ALL file and folder names (e.g., `my-component.ts`, `user-service.ts`, `api-routes/`)
- you MUST ALWAYS use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., `const userName = ''`, `function getUserData()`)
- you MUST ALWAYS use PascalCase for types, interfaces, and classes (e.g., `type UserData = {}`, `interface ApiResponse`)
- you MUST ALWAYS use ALL_CAPS for generic type parameters (e.g., `Result<DATA, ERROR>`, `ApiResponse<RESPONSE_TYPE>`)
- you MUST ALWAYS use functional programming patterns - prefer pure functions and immutability
- you MUST ALWAYS use async/await over Promise chains
- you MUST ALWAYS use try/catch for error handling in async functions
- you MUST ALWAYS use index files ONLY for re-exports, never for containing logic or implementation code
- you MUST ALWAYS run `pnpm validate` after making changes to verify everything works
- you MUST ALWAYS use pnpm as the package manager, never npm or yarn
</rules>

# Guidelines

You SHOULD follow all guidelines within the <guidelines> tags.

<guidelines>
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use pure functions wherever possible - avoid side effects in business logic
- Implement data transformation using functional pipelines (map, filter, reduce)
- Structure async operations with proper error boundaries using try/catch
- Use explicit return types on functions for better type safety
- Organize imports: external libraries first, then internal modules, then relative imports
- Prefer named exports over default exports for better refactoring support
- Use barrel exports in index files to create clean public APIs
- Structure files by feature/domain rather than by file type
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- Use TypeScript strict mode features for better type safety
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Prefer small, testable functions over large monolithic implementations
</guidelines>

# File Structure Patterns

## Basic Structure
```
src/
  features/
    user-management/
      index.ts           // Re-exports only
      user-service.ts    // Implementation
      user-types.ts      // Feature-specific types
      user-utils.ts      // Utility functions
  shared/
    utils/
      index.ts           // Barrel exports
      date-helpers.ts    // Pure utility functions
    types/
      common-types.ts    // Shared type definitions
```

# Code Examples

## Pure Function Pattern
```typescript
const transformUserData = (rawData: RawUser[]): User[] => {
  return rawData
    .filter(user => user.isActive)
    .map(user => ({
      id: user.id,
      name: user.fullName,
      email: user.email.toLowerCase(),
    }));
};
```

## Async Function with Error Handling
```typescript
const fetchUserById = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${error}`);
  }
};
```

## Generic Function
```typescript
const processApiResponse = <DATA>(
  response: ApiResponse<DATA>
): ProcessedResponse<DATA> => {
  return {
    data: response.payload,
    success: response.status === 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
};
```

## Index File (Re-exports Only)
```typescript
// features/user-management/index.ts
export { userService } from './user-service';
export { transformUserData } from './user-utils';
export type { User, CreateUserData } from './user-types';
```
