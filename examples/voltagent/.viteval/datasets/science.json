      "input": "A 5.0 kg block is pushed up a rough incline that makes a 20° angle with the horizontal with an initial speed of 8.0 m/s. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is 0.30. How far up the incline does the block travel before momentarily coming to rest? Use g = 9.8 m/s^2.",
      "expected": "Using energy or kinematics with constant deceleration: a = −g(sinθ + μk cosθ). Then 0 = v0^2 + 2 a s ⇒ s = v0^2 / [2 g (sinθ + μk cosθ)]. Plugging in: sin20° ≈ 0.3420, cos20° ≈ 0.9397, so sinθ + μk cosθ ≈ 0.3420 + 0.30×0.9397 ≈ 0.6239. Thus s ≈ 64 / (2×9.8×0.6239) ≈ 64 / 12.23 ≈ 5.23 m. Answer: about 5.23 m up the incline."

Adding 0.0100 mol HCl converts A− → HA: new moles A− = 0.100 − 0.0100 = 0.0900 mol; HA = 0.100 + 0.0100 = 0.110 mol. pH = 4.76 + log(0.0900/0.110) = 4.76 + log(0.818) ≈ 4.76 − 0.087 ≈ 4.67.
